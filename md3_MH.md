### Physical health assessment

-	Major mental illness increases risk for medical conditions and risk for premature death from physical morbidity
-	Screen, assess and facilitate treatment re. physical comorbidity for pts with mental illness

Reviewing a patient:
-	Physical health history incl. substance use and medical complications of this
-	Family history of physical health problems
  + Beware prescribing meds which increase risk of diabetes or CVD complications
-	Physical exam
  + CVD exam
  + Respiratory exam
-	Routine investigations at baseline and again at intervals in metabolic monitoring guidelines
o	FBE, UEC, LFT, TFT, fasting lipids and glucose, prolactin levels, vitamin D, vit B12, ECG
  + Intervals more frequent if clinically indicated eg weight gain or medication changes

Patients on __clozapine__:
-	Increased risk of __neutropenia__ and __myocarditis__
  + Most risk in first 18 weeks of treatment
  + Symptoms can be nonspecific flu-like symptoms
  + FBE and ECG
-	Increased risk of __constipation__ leading to __bowel obstruction__
  + Mortality risk of bowel perforation
  + Prescribe aperients
  + Practice GI exam


## Anxiety and Related Disorders

Cognitive behavioural standpoint: conditioned responses, habitual thinking and behaviour --> anxiety

Biologic standpoint: disturbed central neurotransmission + stress pathways (HPA axis and sympathetic NS) --> anxiety

### Core Diagnoses

-	__Panic attack__: 4/13 symptoms from the heart/breathless/fear clusters
  + 3 heart: palpitations, chest pain, nausea
  + 5 breathlessness: SOB, choking sensation, dizziness, paraesthesias, chills or hot flushes
  + 5 fear: fear of dying, fear of going crazy, shaking, sweating, derealisation, depersonalisation
-	__Panic disorder__: recurrent unexpected panic attacks AND following attack, at least one of persistent concern, worry about implications or significant change in behaviour +/- agoraphobia
-	__Simple phobias__: anxiety linked to something resulting in avoidance impeding function
  + Exposure/response prevention (EX/RP)
-	__Social anxiety disorder (SAD)__/Social phobia: avoidance of new social situations for fear of embarrassment/humiliation
-	__Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD)__: predominant free-floating anxiety most days > 6 months. 3/6 sx.
-	__Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)__: obsessions +/- compulsions persisting for >1 hour/day
-	__Post-traumatic stress disorder__: the person has experienced a traumatic event and responded with intense fear, helplessness, horror
  + Re-experiencing the trauma by intrusive memories, flashbacks, nightmares
  +	Avoidance of stimuli associated with trauma
  +	Numbing of general responsiveness: avoiding things associated with the trauma, amnesia for the trauma, restricted affect and activities, detachment, foreshortened future
  +	Arousal symptoms: insomnia, irritability, hypervigilance, startle response, poor concentration

### Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD)

-	GAD = __excessive free-floating anxiety__ or worry __most days__ for at least __6 months__
-	Symptoms: need 3/6 of
  + Restlessness, feeling on edge
  +	Fatigue
	+ Decreased concentration
  +	Irritability
  +	Muscle tension
  +	Poor sleep
-	Epi: risk increased in low SES, single, divorced. Mean onset 30 yo.
-	Screening: look for excessive worry about minor things, frequent tension
-	Treatment: lifestyle + psychotherapy (CBT in the main) +/- anxiolytics
  + CBT = psychoeducation + stimulus control techniques + cognitive restructuring + behaviour modification + self-monitoring + relaxation + worry exposure + problem solving
  + Other psychotherapies: acceptance and commitment therapy ([RACGP on ACT](https://www.racgp.org.au/afp/2012/september/acceptance-and-commitment-therapy)), mindfulness
  + Anxiolytics: benzodiazepines are effective but have problems with tolerance and dependence. Use short term <6/52 only.
  + Antidepressants: SSRIs and SNRIs useful adjunct when presenting with GAD + mood disturbance.
  + Symptomatic agents: beta blockers
-	Outlook: 50% remission in treatment completers

### Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)



## ADHD

“A persistent pattern of inattention, disorganisation and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that interferes with functioning or development”
-	Pattern of symptoms + co-morbidity + shared risk factors --> ADHD classed as a neurodevelopmental disorder
  + The same data also support arguments to place ADHD within disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorders
-	Don’t usually diagnose <6 years
-	Several symptoms present < age 12 and for > 6 months
-	Present in two or more settings
-	Negatively impacting social, academic or occupational activities
-	Symptoms do not occur exclusively in the setting of another psych disorder

__Pathophysiology__: Associated with genes regulating dopamine and noradrenaline

__Inattention and disorganisation__: inability to stay on task, seeming not to listen, and losing materials, at levels that are inconsistent with age or developmental level.

__Hyperactivity-impulsivity__: overactivity, fidgeting, inability to stay seated, intruding into others’ activities, and inability to wait, excessively for age or developmental level.

### Epidemiology & Risk factors

-	5% of school age kids, 2.5% of adults, M > F
-	Differences in presentation across genders: F more likely to present with inattentive symptoms
-	Many kids with ADHD also have a specific learning disorder
-	Frequent overlaps in childhood with oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder (“externalising disorders”)

Break down into child, parent and medical risk factors

-	Child factors
  + Predisposing but not specific: reduced behavioural inhibition, effortful control/constraint, negative emotionality, elevated novelty seeking
  + Often overlap w/ ADHD: developmental delay, language delay, learning difficulties
  + Possible influences: sleep disorders, nutritional deficiencies, visual and hearing impairments, metabolic abnormalities and epilepsy
-	Parent or family factors
  + Child abuse, neglect, multiple foster placements
  + Smoking during pregnancy is associated; part of this is down to common genetic risk
  + Family interaction patterns in early childhood area unlikely to cause ADHD but may influence its course or contribute to secondary development of conduct problems
  + Ancestral history of ADHD – substantial heritability (but genes correlated with ADHD are neither necessary nor sufficient factors).
-	Medical factors
  + Very low birth weight (<1500g) confers a 2-3x risk for ADHD, however most kids with low BW still do not develop ADHD
  + Exposure to alcohol in-utero

### Types of ADHD

There are three subtypes of ADHD: combined, inattentive, and hyperactive-impulsive
-	Combined type: at least 6 symptoms of inattention and 6 sx of hyperactivity-impulsivity
-	Predominantly inattentive type: at least 6 symptoms of inattention
-	Predominantly hyperactive-impulsive type: at least 6 symptoms of hyperactivity-impulsivity

### Symptoms

Core symptoms of inattention
-	Careless mistakes or fails to give close attention to detail
-	Difficulty remaining focussed during tasks or play (eg lectures, conversations, lengthy reading)
-	Not seeming to listen when spoken to directly (even in the absence of obvious distraction)
-	Not following through on instructions and failing to finish schoolwork, chores, workplace duties
-	Difficulty organising tasks and activities – messy, disorganised, poor time management, fails to meet deadlines
-	Avoids, dislikes, or is reluctant to engage in tasks that require sustained mental effort (eg schoolwork and homework; for older adults, preparing reports, completing forms, reviewing lengthy papers)
-	Often loses things necessary for tasks or activities
-	Easily distracted by extraneous stimuli (includes unrelated thoughts for adults)
-	Forgetful in daily activities (chores, errands, returning calls, paying bills, keeping appointments)

Core symptoms of hyperactivity and impulsivity
-	Fidgets, taps hands and feet, squirms in seat
-	Often leaves seat in situations where remaining seated is expected
-	Runs about and climbs in situations where it is inappropriate (in adolescents or adults may be limited to feeling restless)
-	Unable to play or engage in leisure activities quietly
-	On the go, driven by a motor – unable to be or uncomfortable being still for long periods of time (in restaurants, meetings)
-	Often answers before a question is completed
-	Cannot wait for turn in conversation/in an activity
-	Often interrupts or intrudes on others (eg conversations, games, activities)

Assessment requires a full medical history and examination, including
-	Neurodevelopmental assessment
-	Family history
-	Sociocultural, family and school environments
-	Academic progress
-	Socialisation
-	Behavioural history
-	Formal assessment of hearing, cognition, language and intellect

### Differential diagnosis for ADHD

-	__Oppositional defiant disorder__ – these individuals resist conforming to others’ demands which may look like an attention deficit. Complicating this differential is the fact that some with ADHD develop secondary oppositional attitudes towards mentally demanding tasks.
-	__Intermittent explosive disorder__ – impulsivity is shared with ADHD, serious aggression towards others is not characteristic of ADHD. Individuals with IED also do not develop problems sustaining attention.
-	Other neurodevelopmental disorders – especially disorders with repetitive motor behaviour like stereotypic movement disorder and some cases of autism spectrum disorder; also, the tics of Tourette’s can be mistaken for fidgetiness of ADHD.
-	Specific learning disorder – inattention is impairing only in academics, rather than everywhere as with ADHD
-	Intellectual disability
-	Autism spectrum disorder
-	Reactive attachment disorder
-	Anxiety disorder
-	Depressive disorders
-	Bipolar disorder
-	Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder
-	Substance use disorders
-	Personality disorders
-	Psychotic disorders
-	Medication-induced symptoms of ADHD
-	Neurocognitive disorders

### Treatment and Progression

Management plan is a combination of medication and psychosocial strategies
-	Psychosocial: use behavioural, environmental and time management strategies
  + Behavioural: we try to reinforce positive and reduce negative behaviours; anticipate, plan and teach how to avoid difficulties
  + Environmental: sit up front, avoid distractions, fidget toys, break tasks down, frequent breaks
  + Time management: checklists, prompts, timers
-	Medication: only after age 6
  + 1st line are stimulants: methylphenidate (Ritalin or concerta), or dexamphetamine (with psychologist referral)
  + Safe and effective medications; benefits for long-term social, educational and vocational outcomes greatly outweigh the minimal side effects
  + Meds protect against future substance abuse

Functional consequences:
-	Academic deficits, school-related problems and peer neglect tend to be most associated with elevated symptoms of inattention
-	Peer rejection and to a lesser extent accidental injury are more salient with hyperactive and impulsive symptoms

## Mental Health Act

-	Assessment and treatment to be provided in the least restrictive way
-	Patient should be involved in decisions and have views respected, even if they are receiving compulsory care under the Act
-	Patients are allowed to make decisions which carry risks
-	First Nations peoples should have culture and identity recognised and responded to
-	Carers should have their role recognised and be involved in decision making
-	If receiving compulsory treatment the psychiatrist must give the person a statement of rights and an oral explanation of their rights
-	All patients have access to legal aid as desired

### Assessment order (AO)

AO is analogous to a MET call: "I think there is something worrying/risky here and I need help with that."

Criteria for an AO per the Victorian MHA 2014:
1. Person __appears to have a mental illness__ - a significant disturbance of thought, mood, perception, memory
2. Due to apparent mental illness, the person appears to need immediate treatment to __prevent__:
  + __serious deterioration__ in the person's mental or physical health; or
  + __serious harm__ to the person or another person
3. Assessment/treatment is __available__
4. The assessment/treatment has to be the __least restrictive__ - that which infringes the least on their human rights (e.g. voluntary assessment is not an option)

The time on the AO needs to be 5 mins _after_ the time on the assessment itself.

### Treatment orders (TTOs and TOs)

A Temporary Treatment Order (TTO) lasts maximum 28 days. After this the clinican must decide whether to go to the tribunal, who decide whether to convert to a TO or dissolve the TTO.

### Capacity Assessments

There are only __four criteria__ which must be met if a patient is to be said to have capacity:
1. Understand the information given about illness/treatment options
2. Remember the information given
3. Use the information to make a decision on their treatment
4. Ability to communicate that decision to you the treating team

In reality, if a treatment option is low risk and likely reward, there is a lower bar for passing a capacity assessment than if a treatment option is high risk and less likely to benefit the patient.

### Borderline Personality Disorder

- Unsure how borderline should really be categorised; some say mood rather than personality.
- __90-96%__ of people who have BPD have experienced sexual abuse, many of them as children. Some would argue 100%, and the 6-10% who have not its just undiagnosed.
  * It is easier to blame oneself for this and figure out how they can change themselves to stop it from ever happening again --> very often BPD patients _hate_ themselves.
  * Boundaries are important; boundaries are how we understand the world. One of the ways we understand our identity is by excluding identities we are not. BPD concepts of identity are perturbed - the boundary that a caregiver should not touch us sexually has been shattered --> dysfunctional boundary setting in the rest of their lives. Instead of healthy psychological boundaries, containment in the hospital becomes a surrogate physical boundary.
  * All this comes into trying to avoid institutionalising these patients by admitting them repetitively - even though they may want treatment to get them off the emotional rollercoaster which is BPD.
  * __Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT)__ helps these patients to understand how to take care of themselves psychologically. It is _very_ long-term work and people need to want to do it.
+ __Splitting__ - this can be a defence mechanism (things we do subconsciously to make the psychological reality easier to bear)
  * In BPD things are very black and white: these patients struggle to experience the grey area.
  * Sometimes they can take this approach to relationships and see each in only good and bad terms: someone who does something nice for you is the good object; as soon as they mess up they are the bad object. Doctors are idealised until they totally aren't.
  * Practically, people start to walk on eggshells around BPD patients.

## Psychopharmacology

### First case: Major Depression



Here we have someone who has decompensated in the face of a major life stressor
- major worry is for a major depressive disorder
- if someone is sad or adjusting, they dont respond well to antidepressants
- mild depression responds best to talk therapy
- moderate - psycho + meds
- severe
  * melancholic: medication + psychotherapy +/- ECT
  * psychotic: medication +/- antipsychotics / Enactive

choice of anitD
- usually start with escitalopram or sertraline 100mg daily
- low dose initially and up-titrate over three weeks
- if someone doesn't respond to 150 you aren't going to push it

phases
- acute phase: stabilise acute symptoms; symptom remission
- continuation: restoration of psychosocial funcitoning; prophylaxis ie prevention of relapse
- maintenance: prevention of a new episode or of recurrence

Duration of Rx __after remission__:
- 1st episode: continuation treatment for __at least 6-12 months__. taper gradually.
- 2 episodes within 5 years: at least 3 years maintenance Rx
- 3 or more episodes within 5 years: at least 5 years maintenance Rx
- Psychotic depression or serious suicide attempt may need longterm treatment

### Second case: chronic schizophrenia

medications are broken down by cyp450
smoking affects cytochrome p182 - which is the same guy who breaks down clozapine
- ceasing smoking can cause big variation in clozapine levels (30-50% variation)

- aripiprazole doesnt work for everyone and makes some people restless
- quetiapine: works very well in bipolar. wouldnt rush to put people on it for Scz except in people who get restless or fail aripip.
- clozapine: cancer-like febrile neutropenia. cardiomyopathy. myocarditis. but actually most people die of constipation/perforation!
- risperidone: 1-2 increasing to 6mg daily. major SE is the prolactin elevation.

only 30% of pts who have 1st episode psychosis (UNTREATED) DON'T have another one???

if they get a good response: continue for 12-24 months, gradually taper and monitor and keep them on a low dose.

### factors in medication adherence

Disease
- disorganised thought and behaviour
- paranoid delusions
- hostility
- aggression
- cognitive impairment
Patient
Clinician
Family

monitor adherence regularly - collateral history is helpful
engage family in treatment
keep regimen simple
educate and involve the patient

### third case: mania

initially treat the mania with an anitpsychotic (choose quetiapine) while the mood stabiliser ramps up
- quetiapine antihistamine effects can knock some people out
- some BPAD patients do well on quetiapine alone
- some need Li + quetiapine
- antipsychotics help with the upside (mania) but not so much with the downside (depression)

if they tick over into depression
- consider increasing Li into the 0.7-1 dose range
- consider another mood stabiliser: lamotrigine (stevens johnsons major worry)
- valproate used to be used a lot; causes spina bifida in kids at pre high rates. can worsen PCOS.
- consider adjusting the adjunct antipsychotic
- introducing an antidepressant is controversial as it can cause rapid cycling bipolar; some say its OK if under cover of an antipsychotic

the long and short of it is, presentation and treatment of bipolar is VERY diverse
- many bipolar patients enjoy their hypomanic phase

### medication across the life cycle

Pregnancy
- risk to mother vs risk to kid
- benzos can cause cleft palate
breastfeeding
elderly
children

### Anxiety and related Disorders

Panic attack
Hyper/hypocalcaemia
Sodium levels

short-acting benzodiazepines while u start an antiD; combine with lifestyle, CBT, breathing exercises
